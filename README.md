# Triple-DES-Algorithm
Code and Working of Triple Data Encryption Standard Algorithm

--- Encryption and Decryption of File/Image using Triple-DES algorithm ---

How to write and understand the code is explained within the program as comments
In this, we will walkthrough the process of code execution

-- Encryption --

1 ) When you execute the code in compatible IDE, you will be prompted to enter an input of your choice as shown below for encryption/decryption

Chose operation to be done:
        1-Encryption
        2-Decryption
Your Choice: 1

2 ) Let's select '1' for encryption, then you should enter the local path of the file/image to encrypt

File Path: C:\Users\User1\Dropbox\PC\Desktop\Screenshots1

Note : No single quotes,double quotes or spaces should be entered

3 ) Next the Triple-DES key should be entered 

TDES Key: 784512k

4 ) Then if the operation is successful with no errors you will be prompted as "Operation Done!"

5 ) Now if you try to open the image "Screenshot1", it will show errors like unsupported format.

6 ) You should decrypt the file with the same "TDES Key" to view it normally.

-- Decryption --

7 ) Now again execute the code, and select operation '2' as decryption

Chose operation to be done:
        1-Encryption
        2-Decryption
Your Choice: 2

8 ) You will be prompted to enter the file path, enter the same encrypted file path

File Path: C:\Users\User1\Dropbox\PC\Desktop\Screenshots1

9 ) The same TDES Key should be entered for decryption of the file Screenchots1

TDES Key: 784512k

10 ) Now you can open the file and view it as normally, this is the working of a "Triple DES algorithm".

#if you wish to encrypt text you can do it by writing in a text file and encrypting the text file
